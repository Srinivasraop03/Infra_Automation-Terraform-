# Exclude all .tfvars files, which are likely to contain sensitive data, such as
# password, private keys, and other secrets. These should not be part of version 
# control as they are data points which are potentially sensitive and subject 
# to change depending on the environment.

# *.tfvars

#
# HOWEVER, since the user explicitly has dev.tfvars and prod.tfvars with non-sensitive config
# we will NOT ignore them by default in this specific run, unless requested.
# I will leave them commented out above for educational purposes.

# Ignore override files as they are usually used to override resources locally and so
# are not checked in

# Include override files you do want to check in by negating the pattern
